    <h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>
    <p>In looking for a healthier version of the standard ginger beef, I came up with this non-deep fried version. The longer you marinate the beef, the more ginger flavor it soaks up.</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound round steak, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>12 mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>&#188; cup sweet and sour sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steak, ginger, and soy sauce in a bowl; turn to coat steak. Cover tightly; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat a wok over high heat; pour in beef mixture. Cover wok; cook until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Remove beef from wok.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in wok over high heat; stir in bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, and sweet and sour sauce. Cover and cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir cooked beef into vegetable mixture; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.</li>
    </ol>
